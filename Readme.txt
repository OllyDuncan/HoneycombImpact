ImpactScript: Run this scripts to study a single impact. You can enter sample dimensions, material properties, and then cell geometries

Optimisation can be done as in the example scripts "optimisation function", that inserts loading parameters (such as energy), boundary conditions
(e.g., dimensions), material properties (E), & internal cell parameters into a function, with a target (here to first extend the plateau, then end the impact
impact just before the start of densification
